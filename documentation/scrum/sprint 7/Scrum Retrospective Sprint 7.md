# What happened last week?

Personal Retrospectives: 

### Duncan

Added HTML sanitization. This blocks certain characters from being stored in the database. Also managed to add a package which helps with reducing the risk of mongo injection.

### Tori

Refactored the groups tests and cleaned up some issues with members creating polls affecting themselves.  

### Blake

This week I redid the groups page with fully custom css, including 5 star rating system and cards representing groups. I also redid the links page do display a preview of where the link leads to.

### Jon

This week I added that links are associated with the user who posted them, this is also shown on the app. I also added added better link URL validaton. Thanks @Victoria Bench and @Duncan Smale for the help! üçæ
