# What happened last week?

Personal Retrospectives: 

### Duncan

This sprint was highly successful, I finished integrating the covid surveys into the meetings functionality, where it displays if you are allowed to attend based on if you have a current and negative covid survey. I also added the recommendation of groups based on a users groups and the tags they have.

### Tori

I made a tagging system and added a tagging form to the groups page that allows a user to search for tags. I also made a modal for leaving groups and fixed the issue of stalemates on the polls. I also did a lot of polishing and small bug fixes here and there.  

### Blake

Spent a lot of time polishing everything, improving the search functionality and implementing in person and online meetings. The in person meetings can track users positions and notify the meeting participants if the user gets home. A lot of testing was added to try increase the coverage. Overall a very productive week, a lot got done.

### Jon

Added search functionality for groups. Added viewing links in the groups page. Added more tests for links, coverage % looks good! Thanks @blake denham @Duncan Smale @Joshua Tobias @Victoria Bench for being an awesome team!! ðŸ¥³

### Josh

I made pages for a user to view their personal profile and the profiles of other users. An option was added in for a user to hide their address information. I worked on making a feature to allow a user to choose whether or not to host group meetings however I was not successful in completing this feature so it was left out of the final release.
