Personal Retrospectives: 

### Duncan

Added a link to LogBox and also added secure admin view of the activity log page.

### Tori

 This week I added conditions to inviting and removing group members. Thanks @Jonathan Taylor for helping test the functionality!

### Blake

This week I remade two webpages the landing page and the meetings page, this involved a lot of css and html, but at least it looks good.

### Jon

This week I made the links tab persistent (mongoDB)! Thanks @Duncan Smale for help üëçüèª 

### Josh

Unable to work due to being sick.

# What are we doing this week?

### Duncan

Working on security issues like HTML sanitization and Mongo Injection.

### Jon

Integrate links with groups - at least attempt to. Try to get links to be specific to only groups a user is a part of. Also display this on the links tab.

### Josh

The same stories as last week.
