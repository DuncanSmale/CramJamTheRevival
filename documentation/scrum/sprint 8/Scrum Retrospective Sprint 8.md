# What happened last week?

Personal Retrospectives: 

### Duncan

This week was successful, I managed to implement a settings page that allows the user to change their username, email and location. I also added a hide feature that doesn't display the users email and location string unless they click a button to reveal it.

### Tori

Did a big refactor on the polls to fix some bugs that occurred with creating multiple of the same poll. I also made a new logo and changed some of the layout colours.  Thank you @blake denham and @Duncan Smale for the help! 

### Blake

Reworked the notifications page to and fixed the popup which shows how many notifications are available, also made polls page show all polls that the user has been apart of. Thanks @Victoria Bench for the help.

### Jon

Links are now tied to groups. Links have notes. Links are seeded. A user can choose links from a dropdown. Tests updated. Thanks @Victoria Bench @Duncan Smale ðŸ¤“

### Josh

Got the geocoding to use the address input fields from registration. Used the navigator watchPosition feature to track user live locations for meetings. Thank you @blake denham for all the tips and assistance :)
